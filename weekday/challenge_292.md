# Challenge 292 - Paint the Walls

Given a predetermined rate from a dictionary, write the function that will return the time it takes for a certain number of people to paint a certain amount of walls. Return the minutes as an integer. No rounding is necessary.

## Example
```python
# It takes 22 minutes for 10 people to paint 10 walls.
# How many minutes does it take 14 people to paint 14 walls?

rate = {
  "people": 10,
  "walls": 10,
  "minutes": 22
}

time(rate, people, walls) âžž 22
```
